TipidTracker: A Simple Budget Manager for Students

TipidTracker is a Python-based, text-based budget tracker designed to help students manage their allowance, expenses, and savings habits. The program makes it easier to record daily transactions, track where money is spent, and see summaries over time (daily, weekly, monthly, or overall).

This project was created with the goal of promoting financial awareness and responsibility among students. Many students struggle to keep track of their allowance, which often leads to overspending. With TipidTracker, students can quickly see how their money is being used, set savings goals, and develop better financial habits.

Features:
- Record allowances and expenses with categories and descriptions.
- Automatically saves dates for each transaction (with option to set manually).
- View summaries: daily, weekly, monthly, or all-time.
- See breakdowns by category (Food, Transport, School Supplies, Others).
- Set and track savings goals with feedback.
- Optional export of reports to text files for record-keeping.

How It Works:
Not to worry, our program is easy, and simple to use!

1. The user enters allowance or expenses.
2. The program then organizes transactions and automatically calculates totals.
3. The user gets a clear transaction record and summary report showing balances.
